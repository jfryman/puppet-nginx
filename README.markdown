# NGINX Module

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jfryman/puppet-nginx.png)](https://travis-ci.org/jfryman/puppet-nginx)

James Fryman <james@frymanet.com>

This module manages NGINX configuration.

## Quick Start

### Install and bootstrap an NGINX instance

```puppet
class { 'nginx': }
```

### Setup a new virtual host

```puppet
nginx::resource::vhost { 'www.puppetlabs.com':
  www_root => '/var/www/www.puppetlabs.com',
}
```

### Add a Proxy Server

```puppet
nginx::resource::upstream { 'puppet_rack_app':
  members => [
    'localhost:3000',
    'localhost:3001',
    'localhost:3002',
  ],
}

nginx::resource::vhost { 'rack.puppetlabs.com':
  proxy => 'http://puppet_rack_app',
}
```

### Add a smtp proxy

```puppet
class { 'nginx':
  mail => true,
}

nginx::resource::mailhost { 'domain1.example':
  auth_http   => 'server2.example/cgi-bin/auth',
  protocol    => 'smtp',
  listen_port => 587,
  ssl_port    => 465,
  starttls    => 'only',
  xclient     => 'off',
  ssl         => true,
  ssl_cert    => '/tmp/server.crt',
  ssl_key     => '/tmp/server.pem',
}
```

## SSL configuration

By default, creating a vhost resource will only create a HTTP vhost. To also create a HTTPS (SSL-enabled) vhost, set `ssl => true` on the vhost. You will have a HTTP server listening on `listen_port` (port `80` by default) and a HTTPS server listening on `ssl_port` (port `443` by default). Both vhosts will have the same `server_name` and a similar configuration.

To create only a HTTPS vhost, set `ssl => true` and also set `listen_port` to the same value as `ssl_port`. Setting these to the same value disables the HTTP vhost. The resulting vhost will be listening on `ssl_port`.

### Locations

Locations require specific settings depending on whether they should be included in the HTTP, HTTPS or both vhosts.

#### HTTP only vhost (default)
If you only have a HTTP vhost (i.e. `ssl => false` on the vhost) maks sure you don't set `ssl => true` on any location you associate with the vhost.

#### HTTP and HTTPS vhost
If you set `ssl => true` and also set `listen_port` and `ssl_port` to different values on the vhost you will need to be specific with the location settings since you will have a HTTP vhost listening on `listen_port` and a HTTPS vhost listening on `ssl_port`:

* To add a location to only the HTTP server, set `ssl => false` on the location (this is the default).
* To add a location to both the HTTP and HTTPS server, set `ssl => true` on the location, and ensure `ssl_only => false` (which is the default value for `ssl_only`).
* To add a location only to the HTTPS server, set both `ssl => true` and `ssl_only => true` on the location.

#### HTTPS only vhost
If you have set `ssl => true` and also set `listen_port` and `ssl_port` to the same value on the vhost, you will have a single HTTPS vhost listening on `ssl_port`. To add a location to this vhost set `ssl => true` and `ssl_only => true` on the location.

## Hiera Support

Defining nginx resources in Hiera.

```yaml
nginx::nginx_upstreams:
  'puppet_rack_app':
    ensure: present
    members:
      - localhost:3000
      - localhost:3001
      - localhost:3002
nginx::nginx_vhosts:
  'www.puppetlabs.com':
    www_root: '/var/www/www.puppetlabs.com'
  'rack.puppetlabs.com':
    proxy: 'http://puppet_rack_app'
nginx::nginx_locations:
  'static':
    location: '~ "^/static/[0-9a-fA-F]{8}\/(.*)$"'
    vhost: www.puppetlabs.com
  'userContent':
    location: /userContent
    vhost: www.puppetlabs.com
    www_root: /var/www/html
```

## Nginx with precompiled Passenger

Currently this works only for Debian family.

```puppet
class { 'nginx':
  package_source  => 'passenger',
  http_cfg_append => {
    'passenger_root' => '/usr/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby/phusion_passenger/locations.ini',
  }
}
```

Package source `passenger` will add [Phusion Passenger repository](https://oss-binaries.phusionpassenger.com/apt/passenger) to APT sources.
For each virtual host you should specify which ruby should be used.

```puppet
nginx::resource::vhost { 'www.puppetlabs.com':
  www_root         => '/var/www/www.puppetlabs.com',
  vhost_cfg_append => {
    'passenger_enabled' => 'on',
    'passenger_ruby'    => '/usr/bin/ruby',
  }
}
```

### Puppet master served by Nginx and Passenger

Virtual host config for serving puppet master:

```puppet
nginx::resource::vhost { 'puppet':
  ensure               => present,
  server_name          => ['puppet'],
  listen_port          => 8140,
  ssl                  => true,
  ssl_cert             => '/var/lib/puppet/ssl/certs/example.com.pem',
  ssl_key              => '/var/lib/puppet/ssl/private_keys/example.com.pem',
  ssl_port             => 8140,
  vhost_cfg_append     => {
    'passenger_enabled'      => 'on',
    'passenger_ruby'         => '/usr/bin/ruby',
    'ssl_crl'                => '/var/lib/puppet/ssl/ca/ca_crl.pem',
    'ssl_client_certificate' => '/var/lib/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem',
    'ssl_verify_client'      => 'optional',
    'ssl_verify_depth'       => 1,
  },
  www_root             => '/etc/puppet/rack/public',
  use_default_location => false,
  access_log           => '/var/log/nginx/puppet_access.log',
  error_log            => '/var/log/nginx/puppet_error.log',
  passenger_cgi_param  => {
    'HTTP_X_CLIENT_DN'     => '$ssl_client_s_dn',
    'HTTP_X_CLIENT_VERIFY' => '$ssl_client_verify',
  },
}
```

## Limitations

This module should operate correctly on:

* Debian
* Ubuntu
* RedHat Enterprise Linux
* CentOS
* Fedora
* Other RedHat derived distributions
* Other Debian derived distributions

Pull requests to add support for other distributions and operating systems is
welcome.

Facter version 1.6.2 or higher is required, however support for versions lower
than 1.7.0 will be removed in a future release.
